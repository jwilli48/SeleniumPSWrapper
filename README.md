# SeleniumPSWrapper
PowerShell Wrapper for Selenium

My attempt to make as comprehensive a PS wrapper for Selenium as I can, specifically for Firefox and Chrome browsers.

## TODO
    -Finish Invoke-SeSwitchTo function
    -Missing implementation for the PressKey and ReleaseKey methods for the WebDriver keyboard. 
    -Missing Manage class implementation (for cookies / logs)
    -Mouse implementaion (context clicks / stuff), click commands
    -Theres probably other stuff missing as well
